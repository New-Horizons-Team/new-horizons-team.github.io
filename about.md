We pioneer new security frontiers on the cloud, application, mobile, edge, incident response, engineering, offensive, content protection, and research.

The Cybersec Team is made of people who have the urge to learn and better themselves, always going forward, looking to constantly improve their knowledge and work environment by working together toward the same goal: minimize the company risk without limiting speed and innovation.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this blog, we are excited to promote Cybersecurity and give back to the open source community once it has provided us with so much information and tools to build we have done upon since the beginning of our journey. Thus, we intend to share projects and techniques utilized in our production environment, broadcast new tools, and promote good practices.
