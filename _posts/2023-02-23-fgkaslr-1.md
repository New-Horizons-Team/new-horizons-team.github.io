[comment]: <> (# Shuffling the kernel Linux (aka **FGKASLR**))

This blog post is the first of a series which will present different elements
of a class of attacks known as Control-Flow Hijack, and its defenses.

Here, we'll introduce the concept of **ASLR** and explain a patch
series that intends to fortify the existing implementation for the kernel
Linux (**FGKASLR**).

## Conclusion

FGKASLR is an important protection to mitigate against dangerous attacks that
comes with virtually no cost.

Now let's guide you to how we reached this conclusion.

## ASLR

**ASLR** stands for **A**ddress **S**pace **L**ayout **R**andomization. It is
a security feature that shuffles the program's binary. Its main role is to
protect against a class of attacks known as **C**ontrol-**F**low **H**ijack.

### Control-Flow Hijack (why do we need ASLR?)

These are attacks that involve changing the control-flow from the program
to a malicious one. An example is called stack-smashing, where the attacker
injects a malicious program through a buffer overflow and corrupts a return
address, diverging the control-flow of the program to the injected binary.

Nowadays we know that an attacker can take control of a target machine
without the need of injecting any code, just by using the executable
binary that is already available in clever ways.

### Popular implementation

**ASLR** is already supported by most compilers and linkers. GCC for example
has the flag `-fPIE`
([reference](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html))
which creates **P**osition **I**ndependent
**E**xecutables. This implementation of ASLR will compile the program using
relative addresses for local assets, and a reference table for the global
ones. When the program is executed, the linker will place the binary in a
random offset in memory. The other libraries that are linked with the program
will also be placed in random offsets creating a unique distribution in memory
for every execution.

Figure 2: ASLR example

Most GNU/Linux distributions come with ASLR enabled by default. By using the
virtual file `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` we can tell the kernel if
the linker should randomize or not the addresses of the binaries.

### How ASLR works against CFH?

ASLR is an important tool to mitigate CFH because the attacker will need
to find out all the necessary addresses to perform the attack every time
the program starts, and most of the time the attacker doesn't even have
the means to find these addresses.

From the example in Figure 1, ASLR would randomize the stack position
inside the memory, so the attacker would need extra information to corrupt
the return address to point to the injected code.

It's important to note that ASLR doesn't fully block CFH. It still possible
that the attacker may find the address layout of a program through some
vulnerability. However, ASLR adds a protection layer with virtually no cost
that makes the attacker's life a lot more complicated, now depending on
another vulnerability to being able to set up the CFH.

## **F**unction **G**ranular **K**ernel **ASLR** (FGKASLR)

### **K**ernel ASLR (KASLR)

Currently, Linux already supports ASLR, but in a rather limited
implementation. The kernel binary is composed of one blob, and the
randomization applied at boot time only affects the offset of where the
kernel is placed in memory. This implementation is called KASLR.

Figure 3: KASLR
![Figure 3](/assets/sec-eng/img/kaslr.png "Figure 3: KASLR")

If an attacker plans to perform a CFH, it needs to find that offset, but once
it's found, all the necessary addresses are also found since they will always
be at a fixed distance from the offset.

### The new implementation

FGKASLR proposes to shuffle every function inside the blob. Now if an attacker
can find one address, this will give no information about the other
required address, as they are randomly distributed inside the blob.

Figure 4: FGKASLR
![figure 4](/assets/sec-eng/img/fgkaslr.png "Figure 4: FGKASLR")

This implementation is strongly based on `.text` regions. This is how the
executable part of a binary is identified by the linker and loader.
It's possible to have many `.text` regions in the same binary.

There are 3 main changes introduced by the patch that implements FGKASLR:

* C code is now compiled with the flag `-ffunction-sections`. This flag is
responsible for placing every function compiled in a separate `.text` region.
* A change in the entry and exit point of assembly functions so that when
the FGKASLR is defined, these functions are pushed to separate text regions.
* A new code that is executed at boot is responsible for shuffling the text
regions in memory.

## Challenges in protecting the kernel

The kernel is very important to protect because the programs executed in
its space have high execution privileges and access to most of the system
resources. At the same time, protecting it is very challenging because it
is a tool that almost every other software depends upon, so
efficiency is a core requirement. This is why kernels are usually
implemented in low-level languages and assembly. Unfortunately, one of the
tradeoffs we must face when maximizing efficiency is security. We now face a
situation where the kernel is written mostly in C, so there is no way to know
if it has or not vulnerabilities that can be exploited by CFH, and many of the
protections against these attacks come at the cost of efficiency, so they are
often hard choices to make.

FGKASLR is beautiful because it's an easy choice. The greatest cost it adds
is only at boot time, when the text spaces are shuffled. Apart from that
the shuffling can have some weird effects on cache alignment, which can make
things worse in some cases, and better in others, but usually by such a small
margin that it can easily be ignored.
Besides that, it's an even stronger implementation than the popular ones used
in userspace, as they are usually done at library level, and this one is in
function.

## Extra curiosities

### Windows implementation

Windows' implementation of user-space ASLR is a bit different. The `.dll` files
aren't compiled to be position independent, so addresses references are solved
when the `.dll` is loaded. When we combine this with the fact that the OS
tries to map the same `.dll` in memory to different processes, two limitations
are shown:

* the `.dll` must be in the same memory position for **every**
process. This means that if the address of the `.dll` is leaked by one of the
processes, that address can be used to exploit another.
* In the case where process **A** and **B** are both using the same `.dll`,
if we restart **B** while **A** is still running, the position of the `.dll`
will remain the same in **B**.

For kernel-space windows also use KASLR.

### Attacks to KASLR

#### DrK
[DrK](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Jang-Breaking-Kernel-Address-Space-Layout-Randomization-KASLR-With-Intel-TSX-wp.pdf)
is an attack that instead of exploiting a kernel memory vulnerability to leak
the an address from the kernel, it uses hardware functionalities to do so.

Intel provides **TSX** instructions for implementing _transactional memory_
operations. What is necessary to understand the attack is that these
instructions create a code region in user space where any failure in execution
returns the control to the user, even the ones like page fault which should
block the execution and redirect the flow to the kernel to handle it.

The researchers found out that the system takes an amount of time to identify
the failure, and that the time is different for each failure.
By measuring the time the systems take to fail to access a random memory
address, they can determine if that page is in kernel space and is executable.

Since there is no randomization inside the kernel besides the initial offset,
once they find out where the kernel starts they will know its exact memory
layout, enabling them to exploit any known memory corruption available.

With FGKASLR, finding where the kernel is would give no information of its
layout.

#### CVE-2020-28588
The [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28588) is
related to a kernel bug where reading from `/proc/pid/syscall` would leak
memory content, among them pointers to the kernel stack. This CVE was
present from kernel version 5.1 to 5.9. With the current KASLR, the
leaking of a single memory address could be enough to find the whole
kernel layout. With FGKASLR this leakage would give minimal information
to the attacker, mitigating greatly the hazard caused by the vulnerability.

## Stay tuned

In other posts, we intend to better explain how CFH works to paint a better
picture of why it can be such a dangerous attack, and we also intend to
post about some other protections that exist against it.
Stay tuned ;)
